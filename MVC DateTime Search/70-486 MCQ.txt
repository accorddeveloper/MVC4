1.  You are designing an application in which a section of the main page will be populated by content from a third-party provider. You do not have control over the responsiveness of the client or how much information will be returned with each request. The call is to a RESTful service and will return the information formatted in Extensible Markup 
Language (XML). What is the best way to implement this application?

A.  Design a model that handles the data call to populate the model. Create a partial view containing only this display area and put an asynchronous service call that returns this model in the partial view controller.
B.  Put a synchronous service call into the main page controller.
C.  Create a partial view containing only this display area and put a synchronous ser-vice call in the partial view controller.
D.  Create a partial view containing only this display area and put an asynchronous 
service call in the partial view controller.

2. You have been given requirements for a dashboard page that will contain summary information from your order processing system in a single display table.

A.  Make the various data requests and compile the information in the controller for display.
B.  Create an individual model for each of the data requests, and then create a view-specific model that calls those models and merges the data.
C.  Create a model for the summary data and handle the various data requests within that model as well as the merging of the data.
D.  Create an individual model for each of the data requests and then merge the data on the client side for display.

3. A significant change has been requested in an application maintained within your company. The application is a classic ASP application that uses custom Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers to connect to a relational data repository on a mainframe computer.

A.  It won’t; the requirements state that the application should talk directly to the HR systems’ database.
B.  You should ensure your naming convention for the database as clearly as possible so you can rework your data calls with minimal changes.
C.  You should implement the Repository pattern with the current HR system being the first repository that is built. When the second system comes online, you imple-ment that data access using the same pattern.
D.  You should map the model directly to the database calls, anticipating that you will have to change the model as the new system rolls out.

5. You are developing an application. One requirement is that part of your data access layer needs to be available to a third party, that wants to get this information from a REST URL in XML. Your company does not have experience with web services, but you have several websites running ASP.NET MVC 4. How could you design and provide these new services? (Choose all that apply.)
A.  Task an individual on staff to learn WCF, and have this individual develop and de-ploy these new services using WCF.
B.  Use the Web API to create REST services using ApiControllerin which the serializa-tion type is defined by the Acceptsproperty of the browser.
C.  Build a basic ASP.NET MVC 4 project in which the view simply passes through the information provided by the controller, and the controller manages the code for serializing the response.

35.  You have been tasked with modernizing an application created in ASP 3.0. Part of one of the pages contains HTML that comes as a string from a third-party application as part of a service call that populates part of a form. The same form contains input val-ues for your application. You need to support the same business process as the original application, but you also want to use some MVC features. What is the approach?

36. You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application. You have a set of requirements to create a help section for remote users. Your typical help scheme is help/desktop or help/mobile, so logically this section should be help/remote. The change board wants 
the links in the application to point to the default support site. Which code segment would you use?

name: “Default”,
url: “{controller}/{action}/{id}”,
defaults: new { controller = “Home”,

of Controller.Ajax.cs files. Put the AJAX-specific functionality in those files.

A.  Override the AuthorizeAttributeand apply it to the login action. Run the base method first to handle the authentication and then evaluate the status of the request. If the user is a customer, send the email.
B.  Create a custom action filter that is globally defined and overrides the OnActionExecutingmethod. This action filter evaluates the status of the user and sends the email if it is a customer. 
C.  Override the AuthorizeAttributethat is applied to the login action, check for the user’s authentication status, and determine whether it is a customer prior to send-ing it to the base authentication method.
D.  Create an action filter that overrides the OnActionExecutedmethod and apply it to the login action. This action filter evaluates the status of the user and sends the email if it is a customer. 

40.  You work for a financial services company that deals with many small brokers. Your ex-ecutives want to be able to run a report that details all the actions taken by the brokers on the site as a form of auditing and protection. Neither the application nor system 
currently stores this kind of information. Which of the following are viable solutions? (Choose all that apply.)
A.  Create a globally applied custom action filter that implements the OnActionExecutingmethod. Have it store the user, the URL, and the forms collection 
B. Create a globally applied custom action filter that implements the OnActionExecutingmethod. Have it store the user, the URL, and the forms collection.
C.  Create a globally applied custom action filter that implements the 
OnActionExecutedmethod. Set the AllowMultiple parameter to false in the filter. 
Have it store the user, the URL, and the forms collection.
D.  Override the AuthorizeAttributeand have it store the user, the URL, and the forms 
collection

41. You are adding the capability for users to customize their site’s display colors. You are required to provide a slider that enables users to change each RGB element. What can you do to ensure that this gets treated in the model and stored in the database as a 
single RGB color? (Choose all that apply.)
A.  Strongly bind the sliders to their own individual fields in the model. Ensure that the model unit for color only implements the GET, where you write code that concat-enates the values.
B.  Create a custom model binder that knows to look for the three values and how to put them together to get the single color.
C.  Add the three different elements to the model and ensure that your update state-ment to the database correctly joins the elements to get the appropriate color.
D.  Create a custom model binder that evaluates the entire color customization process and binds the entire model rather than just managing a subset of the information

42. You are working on a AJAX-heavy site, and your script files are separated in your solu-tion by function. You have already implemented minification and bundling, but you are still getting reports of poor performance when users try to access your pages. You can-not replicate the problem locally. What additional steps can you take and still provide the same user experience?
A.  Compress all scripts locally and have the users download the compressed files rather than the uncompressed files.
B.  Turn IIS compression on, turn on the option to compress dynamic pages, and set the minimum file size to 0 so that every file served will be compressed.
C.  Turn IIS compression on, disable dynamic page compression, and set the minimum file size to the size of your smallest bundled script file.
D.  There is nothing more to do without redesigning the site.

C.  You should bundle and minimize scripts and CSS files together for maximum effectiveness.
D.  Not bundling logically linked scripts together can have a negative effect on performance.

44.  Your U.S.-based company recently opened an office in England. Staff members have been making lots of sales calls, which have generated an increase in visits to the company’s websites. Much of the activity involves downloading sales sheets, product 
descriptions, and other sales support information currently stored in PDFs. There have been some performance-related complaints from remote sales staff, but no local users have noticed any problems. Which of the following are potential solutions? (Choose all that apply.)
A.  Bundle and minify the PDF files to ensure that there is no wasted space.
B.  Write an action result that takes a file name and returns a compressed version of the file for download.
